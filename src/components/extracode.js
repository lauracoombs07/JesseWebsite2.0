        Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor of Applied Linguistics at Northern Arizona University.

As a researcher, I specialize in the use of corpus linguistic methods to explore patterns of language variation across registers of academic prose and the internet. I'm also interested in issues related to quantitative linguistic research, including corpus design and representativeness, methodological triangulation, and the application of multivariate statistical techniques to language data.
