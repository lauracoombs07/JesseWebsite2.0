This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
 
Started with React. Added firebase. I am contemplating switching to mongoDB to get practic using RESTful API but not sure if that will mess things up. I started with some base HTML that Jesse had from his old site. The old site was all HTML. I used react components and Bootstrap to update the looks, make it more user friendly and to integrate a database which will allow him to keep the information up to date more easily. 

Lots of practice using CSS. I was somewhat inconsistent with my styling as I was also interested in learning Styled Components. You can see as the project progresses, hopefully, that my techniques improve as well. While not always consistent, I was always learning new and better and more efficient ways to write and style code.

At one point I overwrote my master repository with a very early commit (accidentally) and I thought all was lost. After a lot of research and learning, I was able to recover the entire project which was a major victory for a beginner such as myself.
